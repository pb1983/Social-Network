## Description

  This project simulates the routing relationships of a social networking platform by utlizing a NoSQL database. Using embedded and sub-document population, different models and schemas are able to reference each other to produce a cohesive compilation of user's thoughts, thought reactions, and friends within their respective network. All routes are tested using Insomnia to ensure that each data element can be created, updated, read, and deleted (CRUD).

## Installation

- Node.js - To download the latest version of npm, on the command line, run the following command: 
"npm install -g npm". Once installed, the routes can be accessed by typing "node index.js" in the terminal. 

- Express.js - Create a package.json first with the npm init command. Installation is done using the npm install command: $ npm install express

- Mongo DB - Download Mongo DB and Mongo DB Compass. You will also need to install Mongoose to manipulate data elements in VS code that are stored in the database. This can be done by typing "npm install mongoose" in the terminal .
